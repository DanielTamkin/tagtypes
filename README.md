if you've seen a bug or think that tagtypes could be better in any way, [create a new issue](https://github.com/DanielTamkin/Evergreen/issues) or Tweet me [@CodeHands](https://twitter.com/CodeHands).
### What is it?
 tagtypes is my solution to the very simple problem with ghost: "where the heck are post types?" you see it in almost every other CMS, wordpress is a great example. Sure ghost is "a blogging platform", but maybe *I* want to have the power to change my bland old looking post, to something diffrent... tagtypes does just that.
### Installation
 1. clone tagtypes to your theme your working on
 2. drag all the `partials` for tagtypes into your `partials` folder
 3. edit tagtypes how you'd like, using the guidelines below.

##### by the way...
- tagtypes is **not** a ghost theme.
- you dont need to be experienced in handlebars to reek tagtypes powers.
- if used right, tagtypes can be super powerful for your next theme.

### What is it?
Tagtypes is a way to introduce different styled posts, loops and tags for ghost. All determined by the `tag` variable.

### Installation
 1. clone tagtypes to your theme your working on
 2. drag all the `partials` for tagtypes into your `partials` folder
 3. edit tagtypes how you'd like, using the guidelines below.

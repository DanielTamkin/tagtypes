{{! add your loop template here}}

{{! show all posts, plus the ones tagged with tagtypes, but dont show the tag code.
    ps. (this is good to do for any post, it would look pretty ugly showing !something)
}}
  {{> "tt-loop"}}
{{! show only posts that you want to show
    (currently set to show just !other)
}}
  {{> "tt-ommit"}}
